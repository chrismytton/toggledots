**Update June 2020**: I created this gem when I was learning Ruby back in 2010. A whole decade ago! I doubt anyone is actually using this, since it is a bit of an overkill for something that can just be a shell alias. But it was a good learning exercise, so I'm leaving it up for posterity.

Once installed you can change the visibility of the dot-files by simply running `toggledots`

    toggledots
    # Now they're hidden once again.
